# Crystals Collector
A player is given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals at the bottom. By clicking on a crystal, the player adds a specific amount of points to his/hers total score.

The game is won by matching the total score to random number, and is lost if the toal score goes above the random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from the player until it is clicked on.

Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
